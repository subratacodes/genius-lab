# ðŸš€ Subrata Mahanto â€“ The Empire Manifesto

I was not born into power. I am building it â€” from 0.

My mission is clear: to create a â‚¹10,000+ crore multi-sector empire that spans biotech, AI, SaaS, chemicals, space, and beyond. From freelancing and coding to global innovation â€” every day, every line of code, every challenge is a brick in this foundation.

I will not wait for opportunity. I will build it.  
I will not copy the past. I will invent the future.  
I will learn fast, fail faster, and scale relentlessly.  

Inspired by Elon Musk, but aiming beyond.  
This is not just about business. Itâ€™s about legacy.  
India will rise â€” and I will lead one of its greatest companies.

**This is Day 1. And I will not stop until the empire is built.**

â€” Subrata Mahanto
